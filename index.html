        <ol>
          <li><b>Introduction: </b> There are an introduction for both problems and the description of the variables we are going to use. </li><br>
          
          <li><b>Vehicles: Data description:</b> There is the data frame description of the vehicles data set, where we can show a different number of entries, search any value or sort the variables. </li><br>
          
          <li><b>Vehicles: Descriptive analysis:</b> In the following panel, we are able to observe two tabs, one for the numerical variables where we can see their histogram, and the other one for the categorical ones, where we can see their barplots to see the relationship between our target variable and the rest of predictors. </li><br>
          
          <li><b>Vehicles: Statistical models:</b> In this page, we can perform some statistical and machine learning models, selecting the partition of the data that goes in the training set, the variables that will be employed, and the model, which can be logistic regression (glm), k nearest neighbors (knn) or random forest (rf).</li><br>
